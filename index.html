              <li>What are you using this interface for?</li>
              <li>Do you consider this a “normal” use of this oven? Do you feel that the interface of the oven is theoretically designed to accommodate the way you are using the oven?</li>
              <li>Does the oven effectively accomplish your task?</li>
              <li>Is there anything about the oven’s interface you find inconvenient? Is there anything you would change about the oven if you could?</li>
              <li>Does this oven’s interface have a learning curve?</li>
              <li>Is this oven’s interface unique from other oven interfaces you have interacted with? In a good way, a bad way, or a neutral way?</li>

                <li>Users complained of a disconnect between the temperature displayed on the interface and the temperature of the oven (with the “true” oven temperature inferred based off irregular cook times)</li>
                <li>The oven's timer function was complicated and difficult to use, so users generally opted to use phone timers instead</li>
                <li>The often is located in a frequently-used part of the kitchen that often requires cleaning prior to use</li>
                <li>Some of the buttons were defunct, but this was only noticed by users who were not using the oven to cook</li>
              </ol>

                Persona #1: This user is attempting to cook food. The interface problems this person faces are generally related to the disconnect between true oven temperature and displayed temperature, cleanliness of the oven space, and difficulty of the timer. Remy the chef outlines the thought process and actions of someone attempting to cook food.

                Persona #2: This user is just messing around with the buttons on the oven. The problems this person faces are generally related to broken buttons, unsatisfying oven sounds, and potential safety risks. The ADHD passerby represents the thought and actions of someone who is just bored and playing with the oven for fun.
